# Solidity Smart Contract Compilation and Deployment Node Modules

Contains code to compile and deloy solidity smart contracts to various networks (with some configuration, of course). This repository contains a Compiler and Deployer component, ```npm run <command>``` configurations for testing, custom deployment, and an example contract deployment, as well as a ```config.js``` file for wallet configuration. At the moment, the Rinkby test network is configured into ```config.js```. 

The goal of this project is to help new and experienced solidity developers alike focus on smart contract development in a local environment contract. (rather than using remix). By the end of this guide, you will have a local node.js project set up to compile and deploy your own Solidity smart contracts. GLHF!


## Getting Started

Disclaimer: 
The dependency versions in this tutorial are known to work together. One could certainly use more recent versions of the various dependencies. If updating to recent dependencies seems daunting, start out following the steps exactly as explained here, and then work to upgrade versions aftwards. So... let's get to work. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
